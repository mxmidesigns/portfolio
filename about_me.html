						Greetings! My name is Mai Nguyen, a self-motivated UX designer with a specialization in UI design. I like to analyze interactivity in everyday life and explore concepts of aesthetics and interactive experience design. <br><br>
						Before, I graduated with a Business major. Many people wonder "What made you change your study?" Working 2 years at Apigee Corp. & Peloton Technology sparked up my interest into tech. I gathered the courage and started a Bootcamp at CareerFoundry and realized generating creative ideas from user's point of view to create life-impactful design and beautigul experiences is what I enjoy doing. I love to understand and learn more about user behavior. I want to make sure people have a delightful experience with thoughful design.<br><br>
						My interests include: Playing jazz music on the piano, reading on Cultural Anthropology, drawing with vector graphics, learning programming languages on the side, and finding brunch places that sell avocado toast.
